# 👁️‍🗨️About Me:
I’m a Mathematics graduate with a Master’s in Big Data & Visual Analytics and hands-on experience in data-driven environments. As a Data Consultant at SDG Group and former Data Scientist at Sensesbit, I’ve developed robust ETL pipelines, automated workflows, and extracted actionable insights using tools like Power BI, R, SQL, DBT, and Airflow.

I thrive on solving complex problems, building scalable data solutions, and collaborating across teams using Agile methodologies like SCRUM and LEAN.

My work is based on transforming raw data into strategic decisions and delivering impactful dashboards and predictive models. I’m constantly learning and seeking challenges in analytics, data engineering, and machine learning.<br><br>
